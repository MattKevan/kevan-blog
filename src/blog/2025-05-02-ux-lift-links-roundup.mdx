Just published the latest edition of my UX Lift newsletter. It's supposed to be fortnightly, but what with one thing and another I'm only managing about one a month.

Anyway, [here it is](https://uxlift.beehiiv.com/p/ux-lift-links-roundup-9d0d), it's got some good stuff in, including a thoughtful piece about AI and design, more open source fonts than you can shake a stick at and some very punny business names.
