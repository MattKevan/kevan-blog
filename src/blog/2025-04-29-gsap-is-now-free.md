As per the announcement on [Webflow's website](https://webflow.com/blog/gsap-becomes-free):

> We’re fully committed to investing in GSAP’s future, guided by your feedback and the expertise of the original GSAP team who brought this technology to life. And that investment starts with making GSAP 100% free for all users. 

> This means everyone — whether or not you’re a Webflow customer — will be able to leverage all of GSAP’s tools completely free of charge, including the previously paid Club plugins. We’re also expanding the standard license to cover commercial use, so you’re fully empowered to use GSAP anywhere, at no cost to you.

Pretty good that it's been made free - I've been using it since the Flash days and purchased it at a couple of different workplaces. It's an amazingly stable and full-featured library, though I always thought they missed a trick by not building a nice GUI on it. Newer apps like Rive are definitely taking mindshare if not marketshare.

Having said that, it's sad that its no longer an independent product. Nothing against Webflow, they seem like a good company, but when a product is bought out and no longer has to compete for users it stops serving their needs and is instead beholden to the whims of its owner. Let's hope it avoids that fate.
