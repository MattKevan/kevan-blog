Igorrr is back with his first new track in five years and it's a banger. More breakcore than his more recent stuff that leans harder into metal, but it's a load of fun.

The video is great too – surreal, disturbing and a perfect use of generative AI. If you can't use it to create giant exploding brains with legs and babies with old man faces, then what can you use it for?

I've been having fun trying to guess which models they used – it's got the waxy, retro look of Midjourney, and I've definitely had similar results to some of the shots using Runway. I'm sure they used many more than those though.
